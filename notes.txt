TODO: newest incoming kanbans at top, oldest at bottom

TODO: start on CFD diagrams (use flot?)

TODO: think about setup config options
         limit kanbans, pull only, push only

TODO: add pad gesture movement as alternative to mouse drag/drop

????: when last column sends done work downstream the empty kanban
      comes back immediately. Raises question of pull coming into
      last column?

NOTE: drag-drop 3 only highlights 3 as match (same size)
      This now works, but 3 is also selected as draggable
      even of there are no target droppables of size 3.
      The reason for this is that pulled has a CSS rule
       .kanban.pulled:hover
      regardless of whether there is a suitable target.
      However this is ok as it means every kanban can be hovered over
      and trying to drag it will reveal its targets (if any)

NB: Wasn't loading in Firefox. Was getting strange diagnostics...
    "Package is not defined"
    Fixed it with
    $ mrt update
    $ mrt install
    After this it loaded in Firefox ok, but bizarrely git diff/status
    showed no difference.
    Now works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera
