o) [New game] needs to somehow have [pull][push] options?
   Or should I put that on each Edge?!
   Like that.
   And wip limits can go on each Edge too.
   Can have two kinds of wip constraint.
      Number of trays.
      Total size of tray sizes.
   Very self-organizing!
   This does not cater for an overall wip limit for the whole board though.
   
o) When 1s have been used the dice div collapses and the team div jumps up.
   Need to make sure the dice div stays the same size.

o) maybe have squares of red/orange/blue/green (in that order) below the
   [start game] button so you can see how many teams have joined. And make it
   a bit more colourful.

o) create initial stories when game is created.
   need to make a copy of that. My idea is that events will be stored in
   an events collection each with a timestamp. The original board could
   then be used to replay the events in a review. And the events could
   be used to create a dashboard.
   Events are created on clients. How do I know their clocks are synchronized?
   I don't. So don't use clocks. Use tick data that is held in collection.
   How to update it? From the server. In which case it might as well be a
   time stamp!
   
o) will need resume/review buttons like in cyber-dojo

o) auto backlog. if you push an empty tray size=5 upstream then it will come back with story size=5

o) backlog as a team which have dice too?
   But they have no upstream.
   And new stories are automatically added.
   Or... they do have an upstream, but when they pull from it, it always succeeds immediately.
   But what if they are in push only mode?

o) no done? except on dashboard

o) drop [1] onto a story to do work on that story.
   capture in jQuery and update the Meteor collection directly.

o) drop [1] onto [unused] area to enable you to reroll the dice
   I like this. If days are not tied edge to edge then a team with an unusable [1]
   have a choice of losing the [1] or waiting for a story to arrive!

o) drop story onto a split-area to split it
   this will offer selection of possibilities. click to select
   eg story 4-7
      options are
          1-7 and 3-7
          2-7 and 2-7
      no that's not right because there is twice the amount of work
      4-7 options are
          1-1=done and 3-6       2-2=done  and  2-5
          1-2 and 3-5            2-3       and  2-4
          1-3 and 3-4            2-4       and  2-3=same as 2-3 2-4
          1-4 and 3-3=done       2-5       and  2-2=same as 2-2 2-5
          1-5 and 3-2=illegal    2-6       and  2-1=illegal
          that's it for 4 since only splits are 1-3 and 2-2
          
   there is another possibility... split to create an empty tray!
   (useful for a pull)
      4-7
          0-1 and 4-6
          0-2 and 4-5
          0-3 and 4-4
          
o) make maximum size of a story/tray 6 to match the sides on a dice
   and to reduce the number of split options that need to be presented.
   
o) how does the tray it is in split?
    size of story must be less than or equal to the size of the tray
    so I can create a deterministic algorithm for this.
    
o) drop an empty tray onto split-area to split it
   again this shows the options and you click on one of them to select it

o) don't synchronize the 'days' ?
   each edge can rethrow dice as often as it likes (but these are recorded).
   In other words, the time periods would be real time periods. One minute say.
   I like this idea. What would happen. Would the edges naturally "equalize"?
   It would also mean that the dashboard could attempt to show the moment an
   event took place by placing it at the relevant horizontal position.
   
o) option to have a single tray colour!?

o) crucial point is that different edges will have different numbers of dice.
   make earlier teams have more dice, later teams have fewer dice.

o) make all edges get processed and all are invisible by default.
   then make the edge matching your own colour visible.
   No that's stupid. Only need to process the collection into html for
   dom creation for your own colour.
   
o) allow dice to be dropped into portals too?
