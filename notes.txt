????: have empty-pullable kanbans in their own area at top of work-area

TODO: newest incoming kanbans at top, oldest at bottom

TODO: start on CFD diagrams (use flot?)

TODO: think about setup config options
         limit kanbans, pull only, push only

TODO: add pad gesture movement as alternative to mouse drag/drop

TODO: setup page offering wip limits?

????: when last column sends done work downstream the empty kanban
      comes back immediately. Raises question of pull coming into
      last column?

NB: a pull movement (request or satisfy) should be leftwards
    a push movement should be rightwards.
