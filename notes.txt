TODO: when last column sends done work downstream the empty kanban
      comes back immediately. Raises question of pull coming into
      last column?

      R <-> B <-> G
TODO: suppose B has sent all its pullable kanbans to R
      and suppose R has sent all its pushable kanbans to B
      this creates deadlock!
      How to resolve?
      Allow pushed kanban to go back upstream?
      Allow pulled kanban to go back downstream?
      Or just let it resolve itself from further up/down stream?

TODO: switch from ones to simple sized work-cards?

TODO: add pad gesture movement as alternative to mouse drag/drop

TODO: start on CFD diagrams (use flot?)
