TODO: Leave thin slice of each portal in the full colour to show team ordering.
      Portal height can be fixed. Only need enough space to drop one kanban at a time.

      Empty kanban sent upstream goes straight into upstream teams' work area?
          At that point you have to select how much work you are requesting?
      
      Full kanban sent downstream goes straight into downstream teams' work area?
          Stays full in the upstream team's colour.
          Empty kanban can be dropped onto it to. The empty kanban then takes
            on the size of the full kanban, and the emptied kanban goes
            back upstream where it becomes a sizeless empty kanban again.
