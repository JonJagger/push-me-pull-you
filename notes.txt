TODO: In green wip area (example)

      o) empty-sizeless green kanban dropped into upstream portal:
          Select how much work you are requesting.
          Goes straight into upstream team (red) wip area as empty-sized green kanban.
      
      o) full (sized) green kanban dropped into downstream portal:
          Stays full of green work; appears in downstream team (blue) wip area.
          
      o) empty-sizeless green kanban is dropped onto full kanban from upstream (red)
           green kanban takes work items, (each reset to not-done-yet), now sized
           emptied red kanban goes back upstream; appears as empty-sizeless in red wip area

      o) full (sized) green kanban is dropped onto sized-empty kanban from downstream (blue)
           blue kanban takes work items, (each reset to not-done-yet)
           empied green kanban changes to empty-sizeless kanban.
           full blue kanban moves to downstream (blue) wip area.
           NEED TO CONSIDER RELATIVE SIZES
             if size-green > size-blue
                some green work is lost?
             if size-green < size-blue
                blue kanban takes work but it not filled, stays in green wip area
           

TODO: switch from ones to simple sized work-cards?

TODO: add pad gesture movement as alternative to mouse drag/drop

TODO: start on CFD diagrams (use flot?)
